# **App Name**: CognitivePM

## Core Features:

- Firebase Project Setup: Initialize Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Hosting, Storage).
- User Authentication: Implement a robust login and registration process (Email/Password & Google).
- Firestore Schema: Design and build the database structure for `users`, `projects`, and `tasks`.
- Personalized Dashboard UI: Build the Personalized Dashboard based on the `index.html` prototype.
- Task Management (CRUD): Implement full functionality for the 'My Tasks' area.  Users must be able to create, read, mark as 'done', and delete tasks. Data must come live from Firestore.
- Simulated AI Features: Populate the 'Risk Prediction' and 'Automated Summaries' widgets with static example data to demonstrate the UI/UX. The 'Smart Create' button opens a simple 'New Task' form.
- Project Detail View (Base): Create a basic view for a single project.
- Project Overview: Implement the 'Project Overview' with a placeholder for the later Gantt chart and display the project's task list.
